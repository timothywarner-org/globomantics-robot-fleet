# Globomantics Robot Fleet Manager V2

**Enterprise Security Demo - GitHub Advanced Security Course**

This is a fictional internal business application for Globomantics Robotics Corporation's robot fleet management system. This application demonstrates **production-grade GitHub Advanced Security** features used by Fortune 500 companies.

## 🎯 Module 3: Automated Dependency Management

This repository showcases the **complete enterprise security pipeline** that 80% of production teams use in the real world:

### 🔒 Enterprise Security Features

✅ **Dependency Review Workflow** (`.github/workflows/dependency.review.yml`)
- Advanced vulnerability filtering (moderate severity threshold)
- License compliance checking (allow/deny lists)
- Automated security reporting in PR comments
- Multi-trigger event handling for efficiency

✅ **Enterprise Dependabot Configuration** (`.github/dependabot.yml`)
- Security-first: Daily vulnerability scans
- Noise reduction: Grouped updates by risk level
- Team workflow: Auto-assign + Copilot reviews
- Smart labeling: `dependencies`, `security`, `automated`
- Risk management: Ignore breaking changes for critical packages

✅ **Production Security Labels**
- 🔵 `dependencies` - All dependency updates
- 🔴 `security` - High-priority security fixes
- 🟣 `automated` - Bot-generated PRs

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT - Educational Use Only
