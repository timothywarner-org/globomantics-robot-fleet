# Third-party scanner: Semgrep (covers Rust, JS, and 30+ languages)
# Semgrep is pattern-based and outputs SARIF 2.1.0 natively, making it ideal
# for augmenting CodeQL with coverage for languages it doesn't support (e.g., Rust).
# GH-500 EXAM TIP: Third-party tools use upload-sarif, NOT codeql-action/analyze
